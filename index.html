    <h4>A few things I've picked up during week 1 
        that is worth remembering:</h4>
    <h5>Why we always should name our main 
        page index.html: </h5>
    <p> The text before .html decides which page we 
        are going to land on and also decides 
        the structure of the html-link.
        <br>
        <br>
        index.html always loads the indexfile
        such as: <i>http://www.examlple.com</i>  
        <br>
        <br>
        Choosing 
        anonther name such as about.html will land you 
        on a different page that looks like: 
        <i>http://www.example.com/about.html</i>
    </p>
    <h5>Shortcuts that are good to know while 
        working in Visual Studio Code:
    </h5>
    <p><b>Command+S</b> - Saves your changes, this is a 
        must in order to get your 
        text to show up on your website. (To make 
        this automated, install "Live Server" to 
        your Visual Studio Code application, then
        just right-click somewhere in your 
        index-file and 
        choose "Open With Live Server").
        <br>
        <br>
        Another way to open your Live Server is 
        by using the short-command: <b>Command+L and 
        then Command+O</b>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To stop using Live Server you use the 
        commands: <b>Command+L and then Command+C.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        To undo the latest action, use: <b>Command+Z</b>.
        <br>
        To redo an action, press: <b>Command+Y</b>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Shift+Command+P</b> - Opens up the 
        Command Palette.
    </p>
        <h5>Things I've noticed that 
            can make future work easier: </h5>
        <p>If you highlight a tag with your cursor, 
            all tags of the same kind will become 
            highlighted as well, 
            making it easier to navigate.
            <br>
            <br>
            The esiest way to open your webpage on 
            your browser of choice is to install 
            "open in browser" to your Visual Studio 
            Code application. This allows you to 
            right-click in your index-file and choose 
            "Open In Default Browser" or "Open In 
            Other Browsers".
            <br>
            <i>If you'd like to open your webpage via 
            Visual Studio Code in your default browser 
            an even quicker way after installing 
            "open in browser", use command: 
            <b>alt+B</b>.</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            You can easily make comments in your work
            by using the tag: < !-- -- >, but without
            the spaces. These will not show up on your
            actual website.
