        <h3>A few things I've picked up during week 1 
        that is worth remembering:</h3>
        <section id="first-section">
            <h4>Why we always should name our main 
               page index.html:
            </h4>
            <p>The text before .html decides which page we 
               are going to land on and also decides 
               the structure of the html-link.
            </p>
            <p>index.html always loads the indexfile
               such as: <i>http://www.examlple.com</i>
            </p>
            <p>Choosing anonther name such as about.html 
               will land you on a different page that looks 
               like:<i>http://www.example.com/about.html</i>
            </p>

            <h4>Shortcuts that are good to know while 
                working in Visual Studio Code:</h4>
            <p><b>Command+S</b> - Saves your changes, 
               this is a must in order to get your 
               text to show up on your website. 
               <br>
               (To make this automated, install "Live Server" to 
               your Visual Studio Code application, then
               just right-click somewhere 
               <br>
               in your 
               index-file and choose "Open With Live Server").
            </p>
            <p>Another way to open your Live Server is 
               by using the short-command: <b>Command+L and 
               then Command+O</b>.
            </p>
            <p>To stop using Live Server you use the 
               commands: <b>Command+L and then Command+C.</b>
            </p>
            <p>To undo the latest action, use: 
            <b>Command+Z</b>.
            <br>
               To redo an action, press: <b>Command+Y</b>.

           <h4>Things I've noticed that 
               can make future work easier: </h4>
            <p>If you highlight a tag with your cursor, 
               all tags of the same kind will become 
               highlighted as well, 
               making it easier to navigate.
            </p>
            <p>The esiest way to open your webpage on 
               your browser of choice is to install 
               "open in browser" to your Visual Studio 
               Code application. 
               <br>
               This allows you to 
               right-click in your index-file and choose 
               "Open In Default Browser" or "Open In 
               Other Browsers".
            </p>
            <p><i>If you'd like to open your webpage via 
               Visual Studio Code in your default browser 
               an even quicker way after installing 
               "open in browser", 
               <br>
               use command: <b>alt+B</b>.</i>
            </p>
            <p>You can easily make comments in your work
               by using the tag: &lt;!-- --&gt;. 
               These will not show up on your
               actual website.
